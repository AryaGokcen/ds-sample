In workshop 1, we covered all python basics in one lesson including:lists, tuples, loops,strings,dictionaries,pandas and additionally we did some plotting. 
In workshop 2, we learned how to use markdown in Juypter also practices pandas and plotting.
In workshop 3, we inspected MPG Dataset. We did descriptive statistics on the MPG Dataset such as: size,shape, len,describe. We detected outliers and excluded them. We also learned the skewness which is statistic that measures the asymmetry of the set of data samples in an univariate data. The skewness for a normal distribution is zero. Negative deviation indicates that the distribution skews left.
In workshop week 4, we practiced Visualization on the Pokemon dataset.

In workshop week 5, we analyzed iris dataset. We used the Linear Regression Model. We splitted the data into test and training. We evaluated model in terms of MSE and R square parameters. We learned the terms named underfitting, overfitting and fitting models. Indication of overfitting is the difference of R square and MSE between test and train results. Overfitting is kind of an enforced unnatural plot which means the predictive curve is crooked to catch the results in a nonsense way. Low MSE in training and high MSE in Testing and high R square in training low R square in testing shows us an overfitting model.
In workshop 6, we practiced logistic regression model on breast cancer data set.
In workshop week 7, we did pokemon clustering which was really interesting. We did Hierarchical Clustering on to Pokemon dataset and dendrogram to books summary dataset. 
 
In workshop 8, we focused on portfolio mostly.This week we covered supervised learning: K- Nearest Neighbours and so we stepped into the machine learning.
 
In workshop 9, we practiced KNN and Naive Bayes Classifier in iris dataset. We did tuning and cross validation. The goal was to build a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of these irises whose species is known, so that we can predict the species for a new iris.
